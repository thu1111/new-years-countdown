            <h2 id="article">History of New Years Eve</h2>
            <p>New Year’s Eve has a rich history, tracing back thousands of years to ancient civilizations that
                celebrated the start of a new year in unique ways. The Babylonians were some of the first to observe New
                Year’s, celebrating it in March with a massive festival lasting eleven days. They saw this as a time to
                renew their commitment to their gods and set intentions for the year ahead, a tradition that still
                resonates with modern resolutions.</p>
            <p>As centuries passed, many cultures adopted their own ways of ringing in the new year. The Romans, led by
                Julius Caesar, shifted the New Year to January 1st with the introduction of the Julian calendar,
                choosing January to honor Janus, the god of beginnings and transitions. This change eventually spread
                across Europe and became a shared tradition, leading people to celebrate New Year’s Eve with feasts,
                gatherings, and hopes for prosperity.</p>
            <p>In more recent history, the idea of New Year’s Eve has grown into a worldwide celebration, uniting people
                in joy, reflection, and anticipation. From the dazzling ball drop in Times Square to fireworks lighting
                up the night in Sydney, each culture brings its unique flavor to this beloved occasion. Today, New
                Year’s Eve is a beautiful blend of ancient customs and modern festivities, where people come together to
                cherish the past year and welcome the new one with open hearts.</p>
